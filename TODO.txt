- Need to know what is in the training and what is in the test set. (IVAN)
- Predict in distribution and out of distribution images + better visualization. (KHANH)
- Cross-validation (UMER)
- Distribution of number of fascicles (CHECK postropcessing.py - KHANH)
- Distribution of area of fascicles (in the original shape) (CHECK postropcessing.py - KHANH)
- Augment with colour and fascicles (UMER)
- Augment with cropping (be careful) (UMER)
- Compute the distance between fascicles (IVAN)
- Morphological opening and closing (IVAN)
- Watershed segmentation (IVAN)
- Understand if there are specific metrics that might penalize errors on borders
