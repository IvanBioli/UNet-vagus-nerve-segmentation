- Need to know what is in the training and what is in the test set. (IVAN)
- Predict in distribution and out of distribution images + better visualization. (KHANH)
- Cross-validation (UMER)
- Distribution of number of fascicles (CHECK postropcessing.py - KHANH)
- Distribution of area of fascicles (in the original shape) (CHECK postropcessing.py - KHANH)
- Augment with colour and fascicles (UMER)
- Augment with cropping (be careful) (UMER)
- Compute the distance between fascicles (IVAN) (QUITE DIFFICULT, NO PACKAGE FOUND)
- Morphological opening and closing (IVAN) -- DONE
- Watershed segmentation (IVAN) -- DONE
- Understand if there are specific metrics that might penalize errors on borders (IVAN) -- DONE

- Comparison of images area threshold
- Cross-loss visualizations for models 
- Custom metrics: IOU, combined_dice_loss, etc.
- Train adn visualize two-ways? (i.e. train with BCE_loss and visualize dice_loss and train with dice_loss and visualize BCE_loss)
