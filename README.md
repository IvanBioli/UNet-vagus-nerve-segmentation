Epoch 20 vagus dataset 7 no transforms: loss: 0.0805 - val_loss: 0.3679


### TODO list
* increase resolution Umer
* add more transformations Umer
* cross validation 
* visualisation + prediction (should take in the same format - normalised rgb images) Ivan
* test model on unlabelled images (from same folder as annotation and different folder as annotation)
* start on write report Ivan
* more results / analysis of model (multiple predictions out of sample with distribution of IOU scores + number of regions)
